# Books4u
DBMS-PROJECT 2017
Every semester we need to buy a new set of books. Buying all the new books is never a pocket friendly solution. So we came up with BOOKS4U which provides you with the following features:
•	No more wasting time and money in travelling (e.g. to avenue road) for buying or selling the books when you can get them within college from your own seniors. 
•	Many a times we  also need to sell our previous semester books which are not required anymore. So you can simply post your book details in our website and we will take care of the rest. Moreover we guarantee that we will get you a decent price for your used books.
•	In case you want a book that is not in the website, no worries you can enter the  book request and we will notify you when it will be available.
